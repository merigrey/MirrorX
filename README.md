# MirrorX
This is a simple program that displays a clock and weather app

## TODOs
1. Cache API responses - only the current weather forecast needs to be checked/updated frequently, look-ahead can be less frequent
2. Move to Linux - Raspi
3. Research Pimoroni Button-shim existing library

### Running the program

#### DEPENDENCIES

    pip install tk

#### ON WINDOWS

    python mirror.py
